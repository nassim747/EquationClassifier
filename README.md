# EquationClassifier
A deep learning model that classifies grayscale images of simple math equations. The images contain two digits, A and B, and the model predicts  A+B. Built with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in PyTorch, this project demonstrates image-based equation solving using deep learning techniques.
